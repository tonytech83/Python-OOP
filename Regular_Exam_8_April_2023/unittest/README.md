Problem 3. Unit Tests
</strong>
</p>

________________________________________________________

You will be provided with another skeleton for this problem. Open the new skeleton as a new project and write tests for the TennisPlayer class. The class will have some methods, fields and one constructor, all of them working properly. You are NOT ALLOWED to change anything in the class. Cover the whole class with unit tests to make sure that the class is working as intended. Submit only the test folder as zip archive.
