<p align="left">

In a folder called **project** create two files: **hotel.py** and **room.py**

In the **room.py** file, create a class called **Room**. Upon **initialization**, it should receive a **number** (**int**) and a **capacity** (**int**). It should also have an **attribute** called **guests** (**0** by default) and **is_taken** (**False** by default). The class should have **2 additional methods**:

- **take_room(people)** - if the room is **not taken**, and there is **enough space**, the guests take the room. Otherwise, the method should return **"Room number {number} cannot be taken"**
- **free_room()** - if the room **is taken**, free it. Otherwise, return **"Room number {number} is not taken"**

In the **hotel.py** file, create a class called **Hotel**. Upon initialization, it should receive a **name** (**str**). It should also have **2 more attributes**: **rooms** (empty **list** of rooms) and **guests** (**0** by default). The class should have **5 more methods**:
- **from_stars(stars_count: int)** - creates a new instance with name **"{stars_count} stars Hotel"**
- **add_room(room: Room)** - adds the room to the list of rooms
- **take_room(room_number, people)** - finds the room with that number and tries to accommodate the guests in the room
- **free_room(room_number)** - finds the room with that **number** and tries to **free it**
- **status()** - **returns** information about the hotel in the following format:

  <b>"Hotel {name} has {guests} total guests
  Free rooms: {numbers of all free rooms separated by comma and space}
  Taken rooms: {numbers of all taken rooms separated by comma and space}"</b>
