Create the following project structure:

![Picture3.png](Picture3.png)

<b>Class Customer</b>

**Upon initialization**, each customer will receive the following **parameters: name: str, address: str, email: str**. Each customer should also have a personal **id** (**autoincremented**, starting from 1). To do the incrementation, you should create a **class attribute id** equal to **1**, which will keep the value of the **id for the upcoming customer**. For example, if there are **no customers**, the class **id** should be equal to **1**. When there **is one customer** - the class **id** should be equal to **2**.

Create a method called **get_next_id**, which returns the **id** that will be given to the **next customer**.

Implement the **__repr__** method so it returns the **info** about the customer in the following format: **"Customer <{id}> {name}; Address: {address}; Email: {email}"**

<b>Class Equipment</b>

**Upon initialization**, the class will receive the following **parameters: name: str**. Each equipment should also have an **id** (**autoincremented**, starting from **1**). To do the incrementation, you should create a **class attribute id** equal to **1**, which will keep the value of the **id for the following equipment's id**. 

Create a **method** called **get_next_id**, which returns the **id** that will be given to the **following equipment**.

Implement the **__repr__** method so it returns the **info** about the equipment in the following format: **"Equipment <{id}> {name}"**

Create a **static method** called **get_next_id**, which returns the **id** that will be given to the **following equipment**.

<b>Class ExercisePlan</b>

**Upon initialization**, the class will receive the following **parameters: trainer_id: int, equipment_id: int, duration: int** (in **minutes**). Each plan should also have an **id** (**autoincremented**, starting from **1**). To do the incrementation, you should create a **class attribute id** equal to **1**, which will keep the value of the **id for the next plan's id**. Create the following **methods**:
- **from_hours(trainer_id:int, equipment_id:int, hours:int)** - creates **new instance** using the provided information
- **get_next_id()** - **static method** that returns the **id** that will be given to the next plan
- **__repr__()** - returns the **information** about the plan in the following format: **"Plan <{id}> with duration {duration} minutes"**

<b>Class Subscription</b>

**Upon initialization**, the class will receive the following **parameters: date: str, customer_id: int, trainer_id: int, exercise_id: int**. The class should also have an **id** (**autoincremented** starting from **1**). To do the incrementation, you should create a **class attribute id** equal to **1**, which will keep the value of the **id for the next subscription's id**.

Implement the **__repr__** method so it returns the **info** about the subscription in the following format: **"Subscription <{id}> on {date}"**

Create a **static method** called **get_next_id** which returns the **id** that will be given to the **next subscription**

<b>Class Trainer</b>

**Upon initialization**, the class will receive the following **parameters: name: str**. The class should also have an **id** (**autoincremented** starting from **1**). To do the incrementation, you should create a **class attribute id** equal to **1**, which will keep the value of the **id for the next trainer's id**.

Implement the **__repr__** method so it returns the **info** about the trainer in the following format: **"Trainer <{id}> {name}"**

Create a **static method** called get_next_id, which returns the **id** that will be given to the **next trainer**.

<b>Class Gym</b>

**Upon initialization**, the class will **not receive** any **parameters**. However, it should have the following **attributes: customers** (**empty  list of customer** objects), **trainers** (**empty list of trainer** objects), **equipment** (**empty list of equipment** objects), **plans** (**empty list of plan** objects), **subscriptions** (**empty list of subscription** objects)

Create the following **methods**:
- **add_customer(customer: Customer)** - **add the customer** in the customer list if the customer **is not** already **in it**
- **add_trainer(trainer: Trainer)** - **add the trainer** to the trainers' list, if the trainer **is not** already in it
- **add_equipment(equipment: Equipment)** - **add the equipment** to the equipment list, if the equipment **is not** already in it
- **add_plan(plan: ExercisePlan)** - **add the plan** to the plans' list, if the plan **is not** already in it
- **add_subscription(subscription: Subscription)** - **add the subscription** in the subscriptions list if the subscription is not already in it
- **subscription_info(subscription_id: int)** - get the **subscription**, the **customer**, the **trainer**, the **equipment**, and the **plan**. Then **return** their **string representations** each on a **new line**.
