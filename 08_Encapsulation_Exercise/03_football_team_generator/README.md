Create a separate file for each class as shown below and submit a zip file containing all files (zip the whole project folder/module) - it is important to include all files in the project module to make proper imports.

Create a class called **Player**. Upon initialization, it should receive:

- Private attribute **name: string**
- Private attribute **sprint: int**
- Private attribute **dribble: int**
- Private attribute **passing: int**
- Private attribute **shooting: int**

You should create property only for the name of the player. The class should also have one additional method:
Override the **__str__()** method of the class so it returns:

**"Player: {name}**

**Sprint: {sprint}**

**Dribble: {dribble}**

**Passing: {passing}**

**Shooting: {shooting}"**

Create a class called **Team**. Upon initialization, it should receive:

- Private attribute **name: string**
- Private attribute **rating: int**

The class should also have a private instance attribute - **players: list** - empty list upon initialization that will
contain all the players (objects)

The **Team** class have the following methods:

- **add_player(player: Player)**
    - If the player **is already in the team**, return **"Player {name} has already joined"**
    - **Otherwise, add the player** to the team and return **"Player {name} joined team {team_name}"**
- **remove_player(player_name: str)**
    - **Remove the player** and **return him**
    - If the player **is not in the team**, return **"Player {player_name} not found"**</p>
