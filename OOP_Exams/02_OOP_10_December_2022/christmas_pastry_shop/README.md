# **Python OOP Exam - Christmas Pastry Shop**


*As we all love delicacies, today you were chosen to build a simple Christmas pastry shop software system. This system must have support for **delicacies** and **booths** in the pastry shop.*

You will be provided with a **skeleton** that includes all the folders and files that you will need.

***Note: You are not allowed to change the folder and file structure and change their names!***

**Judge Upload**

For the **first two problems**, create a **zip** file with the **project** **folder** and **upload it** to the judge system.

For the **last problem**, create a **zip** file with the **test folder** and **upload it** to the judge system.

You do not need to include **in the zip file** your **venv**, **.idea**, **pycache**, and **\_\_MACOSX** (for Mac users), so you do not exceed **the maximum allowed size** of **16.00 KB**.
# **Structure (Problem 1) and Functionality (Problem 2)**
Our task is to implement the **structure and functionality** of all the classes (properties, methods, inheritance, abstraction, etc.)

You are **free to add additional attributes** (instance attributes, class attributes, methods, dunder methods, etc.) to simplify your code and increase readability as long as it does not change the project's final result according to the requirements and the program works properly.
