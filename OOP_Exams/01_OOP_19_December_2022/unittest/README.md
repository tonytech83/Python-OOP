Problem 3. Unit Tests
</strong>
</p>

________________________________________________________

<p align="left">

You will **be provided with another skeleton** for this problem. **Open** the **new skeleton** as a **new project** and write tests for the **TruckDriver** class. The class will have some methods, fields, and one constructor, all of them working properly. You are **NOT ALLOWED** to change any class. Cover the whole class with unit tests to make sure that the class is working as intended. Submit **only the test** folder.
