You will be provided with a skeleton that includes all the folders and files that you will need.

**_Note: You are not allowed to change the folder and file structure and change their names!_**

![Picture1.png](Picture1.png)

_**Judge Upload**_

Create a **zip** file with the **project folder** and **upload it** to the judge system.
You do not need to include **in the zip file** your **venv**, **.idea**, **pycache**, and **__MACOSX** (for Mac users),
so you do not exceed **the maximum allowed size** of **16.00 KB**.

**Structure (Problem 1) and Functionality (Problem 2)**

Our task is to implement the structure and functionality of all the classes (properties, methods, inheritance, abstraction, etc.)

You are free to add additional attributes (instance attributes, class attributes, methods, dunder methods, etc.) to simplify your code and increase readability as long as it does not change the project's final result according to the requirements and the program works properly.

**1. Class Musician**

In the musician.py file, the class Musician should be implemented. It is a base class for any type of musician, and it should not be able to be instantiated.

**Structure**

The class should have the following attributes:

  - A string that represents the name of the musician.
  - If the name is an empty string or contains only white spaces, raise a ValueError with the message: "Musician name cannot be empty!"
- **age: int**
  - An integer that represents the age of the musician.
  - The musician must be at least 16 years old; if not - raise a ValueError with the message "Musicians should be at least 16 years old!"

  - A musician CANNOT learn a skill that is NOT in the list of available types (see below).

**Methods**

**__init__(name: str, age: int)**

In the __init__ method, all the needed attributes must be set.

**learn_new_skill(new_skill: str)**

Each musician can learn a new skill (one at a time):

- If the new skill is not in the skills available for the type of musician, raise a ValueError with the message "{new skill} is not a needed skill!"
- If the new skill is already learned, raise an Exception with the message "{new skill} is already learned!"
- If everything is okay, return the following message: "{musician name} learned to {new skill}."

**5. Class Band**

In the band.py file, the class Band should be implemented. 

**Structure**

  - If the place is less than 2 chars long or has only white spaces, raise a ValueError with the message: "Place must contain at least 2 chars. It cannot be empty!"
  
**Methods**

**__init__(genre: str, audience: int, ticket_price: float, expenses: float, place: str)**

In the __init__ method, all the needed attributes must be set.

**__str__()**

The method returns the following string: "{genre} concert at {place}."
  
**7. Class ConcertTrackerApp**

In the concert_tracker_app.py file, the class ConcertTrackerApp should be implemented. It will contain all the functionality of the project.

**Structure**

The class should have the following attributes:
- **bands: list**
    - An empty list that will contain all the bands (objects).
- **musicians: list**
  - An empty list that will contain all the musicians (objects).

**create_musician(musician_type: str, name: str, age: int)**

The method creates a new musician.
- Valid musician types: "Guitarist", "Drummer", "Singer"
- If the musician type is not a valid type, raise a ValueError with the message "Invalid musician type!"
- If there is a musician with the same name, raise an Exception with the message "{musician_name} is already a musician!"
- If everything is valid, create the musician, add it to the musicians' list, and return a message "{musician_name} is now a {musician_type}."

**create_band(name: str)**

The method creates a new band.
- If there is already a band with the same name, raise an Exception with the message "{band_name} band is already created!"
- If everything is valid, create a new band, add it to the bands' list, and return a message "{band_name} was created."

**create_concert(genre: str, audience: int, ticket_price: float, expenses: float, place: str)**
- If there is already a concert in the same place, raise an Exception with the message "{concert_place} is already registered for {concert_genre} concert!"
- If everything is valid, create a new concert, add it to the concerts' list, and return a message "{concert_genre} concert in {concert_place} was added."

**add_musician_to_band(musician_name: str, band_name: str)**

The method adds a musician to the band.
- If there isn't a musician with the given name, raise an Exception with the message "{musician_name} isn't a musician!"
- If there isn't a band with the given name, raise an Exception with the message "{band_name} isn't a band!"
- If everything is valid, add the musician to the band and return the message "{musician_name} was added to {band_name}."

**remove_musician_from_band(musician_name: str, band_name: str)**

The method removes a musician from the band.
- If there isn't a band with the given name, raise an Exception with the message "{band_name} isn't a band!"
- If there isn't a musician with the given name who is a member of the given band, raise an Exception with the message "{musician_name} isn't a member of {band_name}!"
- If everything is valid, remove the musician from the band and return the message "{musician_name} was removed from {band_name}."

**start_concert(concert_place: str, band_name: str)**

The method is to start a concert at the given place with the given band. The concert place and the band name will always be valid. However, there are some rules for the band to start a concert depending on the band members and the concert type:
- If there is NOT at least one member of each type (at least 1 singer, at least 1 drummer, and at least 1 guitarist), raise an Exception with the message "{band name} can't start the concert because it doesn't have enough members!"
- Then, check if the band can play at the concert:
  - For a band to play at a "Rock" concert, the needed skills for all members depending on the musician type are:
    - Drummer - play the drums with drumsticks
    - Singer - sing high pitch notes
    - Guitarist â€“ play rock
  - For a band to play at a "Metal" concert, the needed skills for all members depending on the musician type are:
    - Drummer - play the drums with drumsticks
    - Singer - sing low pitch notes
    - Guitarist â€“ play metal
  - For a band to play at a "Jazz" concert, the needed skills for all members depending on the musician type are:
    - Drummer - play the drums with drum brushes
    - Singer - sing high pitch notes and sing low pitch notes
    - Guitarist â€“ play jazz
- If one or more band members don't have the required skills to play at a concert, raise an Exception with the message "The {band_name} band is not ready to play at the concert!"
- If all members can play at a concert, calculate the profit by the following formula: "(audience * ticket price) - expenses", and return the following message: "{band_name} gained {profit}$ from the {concert_genre} concert in {concert_place}."
    - Profit should be formatted to the second decimal place.
